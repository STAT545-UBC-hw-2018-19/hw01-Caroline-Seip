In this document we will test some basic functions of R that can be used to explore a dataset. Run each line of code to obtain the output. 

# Loading the data

Start by loading in the 'gapminder' dataset, which we will be exploring. If you don't already have this dataset downloaded, run 'install.packages("gapminder") in your R console.
```{r}
library(gapminder)
```
# Data exploration

Now we will start to explore the dataset, first let's look at the first few rows of data that the dataset contains using the 'head' function:
```{r}
head(gapminder)
```

We can also take a look at the structure of the dataset using the 'str' function:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

We can determine the number of columns in the dataset using the 'ncol' function:

```{r}
ncol(gapminder)
```
